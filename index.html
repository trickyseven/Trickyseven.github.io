            My name is Brett. I am a student at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
            I also work full time at Heitman, a real estate investment management firm.
            I enjoy reading, running, and working with technology. More on this on my <a href="interests.html"> interests </a>page.</p>

    <h4>Early Days</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Northbrook, Illinois, the son of two real estate professionals. I was a pretty active kid, participating in a variety of sports, theater, and outdoor activities growing up.
    I made a few great friends, who I am still close with today. </p>

    <h4>High School</h4>
    <p>When I didn't make the golf team as a freshman, I decided to go out for cross-country and track. It was then that I developed my life long interest in running.
    I also sang with the high school choir, as well as with some of my best friends in an a capella group called "The Bassics". We were pretty good!</p>
    <p>I was also heavily involved in Boy Scouts. I spent summers at camp earning merit badges and selling lemonade to raise money for our troop.
      Fall and spring brought campouts in Wisconsin with activities ranging from mountain biking to rocketry as well as a good amount of community service.
      In 2005, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout, one of my proudest achievements. </p>
      <p>While in high school, I met my now wife, Andrea. We've been together for over 10 years.</p>

      <h4>Undergraduate School</h4>
      <p>I attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where I received a Bachelors of Science in Finance in 2009. I also played Ultimate Frisbee and was president of the club at Miami.
        Oxford is a beautiful place, and I encourage anyone passing through to stop by for a few hours.</p>

        <h4>Professional</h4>
        <p>2009 was the worst year to graduate college. I took an internship for eight months with a company called Heitman. There, I worked in the Portfolio and Asset Management group.
          I was then hired on full time as a staff accountant in the private real estate equity group, working on two separate accounts. My time there taught me much about real estate, investment management, and
          accounting. In 2012, I had the opportunity to transfer into Heitman's Client Service and Marketing group, where I focus on sales support, CRM administration, and data analysis.

        <h4>Graduate School</h4>
        <p>In 2014, I decided it was time to go back to school to expand my knowledge. I was accepted into the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
          There, I have focused my studies on Marketing and Managerial Analytics. My anticipated graduation date is August 2016.</p>
